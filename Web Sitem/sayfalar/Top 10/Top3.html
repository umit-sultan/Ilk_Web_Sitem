	<h4> Şarkı Sözü </h4><br>
	<b>Verse 1</b><br>
The only way to change me is let me blow my brains out<br>
Stuck in the middle of the game to get the pain out<br>
Pray to my God everyday but he don't listen<br>
The poverty bothers me<br>
But mama's working wonders in the kitchen<br>
Listen, I can hear her crying in the bedroom<br>
Praying for money, we never think would she be dead soon<br>
Am I wrong for wishing I was somewhere else?<br>
I'm thirteen, can't feed myself<br>
Can I blame daddy 'cause he left me<br>
Wish he would've helped me<br>
Too much like him 'til my mama don't love me<br>
On my own at a early age, gettin' paid<br>
And I'm strapped so I'll never be afraid<br>
Where did I go astray? I'm hanging in the back streets<br>
Running with G's and dope fiends, will they jack me?<br>
Can't turn back, my eyes on the prize<br>
I got nothing to lose<br>
Everybody gotta die, say goodbye to the bad guy<br>
That one you fucked when you passed by<br>
Buck-buck from a Glock, let the glass fly<br>
Do or die, walk a mile in my shoes<br>
And you'd be crazy too, with nothing to lose<br><br>
<b>Verse 2</b><br>
I thank the Lord for my many blessings<br>
Though I'm stressin' keep a vest for protection<br>
From the barrel of the Smith & Wesson<br>
And all my niggas in the pen', here we go again<br>
Ain't nothing separating us from a Mac-10<br>
Born in the ghetto as a hustler, older<br>
Straight soldier bucking at them busters<br>
No matter how you try, niggas never die<br>
We just retaliate with hate, then we multiply<br>
See me striking down the block hittin' corners<br>
Mobbin' like a motherfucker livin' like I wanna<br>
Ain't no stoppin' at the red lights, I'm sideways<br>
Thug Life motherfucker crime pays<br>
Let the cops put they lights on<br>
Chase me nigga, zig-zaggin' through the freeway<br>
Race me nigga, in a high speed chase with the law<br>
The realest motherfucker that you ever saw<br>
I'm livin' raw 'til they bury me, don't worry me<br>
I'm high livin' like I ain't afraid to die<br>
And you could walk a mile in my shoes<br>
And you'd be crazy too, with nothing to lose<br><br>
<b>Verse 3</b><br>
Ain't no escape from a deadly fate<br>
And everyday there's a million black bodies put away<br>
I'm startin' to lose hope<br>
It seems everybody's on dope<br>
Mama told me to leave 'cause she was broke<br>
Sometimes I choke on the indo<br>
Peepin' out the window alone on my own, I'm a criminal<br>
Got no love from the household<br>
I'm out cold in the streets, give me motherfucking peace<br>
I got nothing to lose, and something to prove<br>
What do I do livin' Thug Life, nigga stay true<br>
I wonder when they kill me<br>
Is there a Heaven for a real G?<br>
Lord forgive me if you feel me?<br>
'Cause all my life I was dirt broke<br>
With no hope, little skinny motherfucker wantin' dough<br>
I hated cutting suckers with my razor blade<br>
But every day it's a struggle to get major paid<br>
Anyway it's so hard on a nigga in this city<br>
No pity and ain't no love for the scrubs that be buyin' dimes<br>
If you could walk a mile in my shoes<br>
You'd be crazy too, with nothing to lose<br>
