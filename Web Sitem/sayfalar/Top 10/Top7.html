	<h4> Şarkı Sözü </h4><br>
	<b>Verse 1</b><br>	
I couldn't help but notice your pain<br>
My pain?<br>
It runs deep<br>
Share it with me<br>
Uh, pain<br>
Pain, pain, pain<br><br>
They'll never take me alive, I'm gettin' high with my four-five<br>
Cocked on these suckas, time to die<br>
Even as a youngster causin' ruckus on the back of the bus<br>
I was a fool all through high school, kickin' up dust<br>
But now I'm labeled as a troublemaker, who can you blame?<br>
Smokin' weed helped me take away the pain<br>
So I'm hopeless, rollin' down the freeway swervin', don't worry<br>
I'm 'bout to crash up on the curb 'cause my vision's blurry<br>
Maybe if they tried to understand me, what should I do?<br>
I had to feed my fuckin' family, what else could I do but be a thug?<br>
Out slangin' with the homies, fuck hangin' with them phonies in the club<br>
Got my mind on danger, never been a stranger to homicide<br>
My city's full of gang bangers and drive-bys<br>
Why do we die at an early age?<br>
He was so young but still a victim of the 12 gauge<br>
My memories of a corpse, mind full of sick thoughts<br>
And I ain't goin' back to court, so fuck what you thought<br>
I'm drinkin' Hennessey, runnin' from my enemies<br>
Will I live to be twenty-three?<br>
There's so much pain<br><br>
<b>Nakarat</b><br>
Tired of the strain and the pain<br>
(Don't get too close because you might get shot)<br>
Tired of the strain and the pain<br>
(Don't get too close because you might get shot, boy)<br><br>
<b>Verse 2</b><br>
Years and years of that rough life<br>
Runnin' crazed and wild as a kid and growin' tough with a knife<br>
And livin' trife on the regular, buckin' out competitors<br>
See 'em fake a move and chase 'em down like the fuckin' Predator<br>
Get in trouble everyday in school, act a fool<br>
And you know I had to break every rule<br>
Showin' off for the bitches, 'cause I had the mad rep<br>
So I had to watch my back when it was time to step<br>
But the grimiest of the grimiest with love for me<br>
Go pop, pop, and send a chuckle up above for me<br>
Ayo, currency kept passin' me by, but I didn't cry broke<br>
Got hit off with the pack and started sellin' coke<br>
And now the money's lookin' lovely<br>
Pop the drop top and now the bitches wanna rub me<br>
Pick up the game, it's all the same<br>
I kick it back, yo, give 'em slack, yo<br>
And now they label me the Mack, yo, people check it<br>
Get disrespected if you front on the Birdman, you heard, man<br>
Catch a couple shots from the Glock in my hand<br>
Damn, at least I'm realistic with my biscuit<br>
You know you get your ass twisted, so run for cover<br>
Me and my man got a plan, kickin' major dust<br>
So if you're on, nigga, look for the gauge to bust<br>
A lot of pressure with the street fame, it's a deep game<br>
And my mama always cryin', yeah, there's so much pain<br><br>
<b>Nakarat</b><br>
So tired<br>
(Don't get too close because you might get shot)<br>
So tired, so<br>
(Don't get too close because you might get shot)<br>
So<br>
<b>Verse 3</b><br>
They got me mobbin' like I'm loc'ed and ready to get my slug on<br>
I load my clip and slip my motherfuckin' gloves on<br>
I ain't scared to blast on these suckas if they test me<br>
Trust, I got my Glock cocked, playa, if they press me<br>
Bust, on motherfuckers with a passion<br>
Better duck, 'cause I ain't lookin' when I'm blastin'<br>
I'm a nut and drinkin' Hennessey and gettin' high<br>
On the lookout for my enemies, don't wanna die<br>
Tell me why, 'cause this stress is gettin' major<br>
A buck fifty 'cross the face with my razor<br>
What can I do but be a thug until I'm dead and gone?<br>
I keep my brain on the game and stay head strong<br>
These sorry bastards wanna kill me in my sleep<br>
I'm real, they cannot see<br>
And everyday is just a struggle, steady thuggin' on the streets<br>
And I'll be ballin', loc, don't let 'em make you worry<br>
Keep swingin' at these suckas 'til you buried<br>
I was born to raise hell, a nigga from the gutta<br>
Word to mother I'm trapped, I'm kickin' dust up, ready to bust<br>
I'm on the scene, steady muggin' mean until they kill me<br>
I'll be livin' this life, I know you feel me<br>
There's so much pain<br>
<b>Nakarat</b><br>
Tired of the strain and the pain<br>
(Don't get too close because you might get shot)<br>
Tired of the strain and the pain<br>
(Don't get too close because you might get shot)<br>
Tired of the strain and the pain<br>
(Don't get too close because you might get shot)<br>
Tired of the strain and the pain<br>
(Don't get too close because you might get shot, boy)
