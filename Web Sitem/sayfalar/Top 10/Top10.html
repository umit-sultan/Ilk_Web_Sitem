	<h4> Şarkı Sözü </h4><br>
	<b>Verse 1</b><br>	
Makaveli in this... Killuminati, all through your body<br>
The blow's like a twelve gauge shotty<br>
Uh, feel me!<br>
And God said he should send his one begotten son<br>
To lead the wild into the ways of the man<br>
Follow me; eat my flesh, flesh and my flesh<br><br>
<b>Nakarat</b><br>
Come with me, Hail Mary<br>
Run quick see, what do we have here<br>
Now, do you wanna ride or die<br>
La dadada, la la la la<br><br>
<b>Verse 2</b><br>
I ain't a killer but don't push me<br>
Revenge is like the sweetest joy next to getting pussy<br>
Picture paragraphs unloaded, wise words being quoted<br>
Peeped the weakness in the rap game and sewed it<br>
Bow down, pray to God hoping that he's listening<br>
Seeing niggas coming for me, to my diamonds, when they glistening<br>
Now pay attention, rest in peace father<br>
I'm a ghost in these killing fields<br>
Hail Mary catch me if I go, let's go deep inside<br>
The solitary mind of a madman who screams in the dark<br>
Evil lurks, enemies, see me flee<br>
Activate my hate, let it break, to the flame<br>
Set trip, empty out my clip, never stop to aim<br>
Some say the game is all corrupted, fucked in this shit<br>
Stuck, niggas is lucky if we bust out this shit, plus<br>
Mama told me never stop until I bust a nut<br>
Fuck the world if they can't adjust<br>
It's just as well, Hail Mary<br><br>
<b>Nakarat</b><br>
Come with me, Hail Mary<br>
Run quick see, what do we have here<br>
Now, do you wanna ride or die<br>
La dadada, la la la la<br><br>
Come with me, Hail Mary<br>
Run quick see, what do we have here<br>
Now, do you wanna ride or die<br>
La dadada, la la la la<br>
<b>Verse 3</b><br>
Penitentiaries is packed with promise makers<br>
Never realize the precious time the bitch niggas is wasting<br>
Institutionalized I lived my life a product made to crumble<br>
But too hardened for a smile, we're too crazy to be humble, we balling<br>
Catch me father please, cause I'm falling, in the liquor store<br>
That's the Hennessee I hear ya calling, can I get some more?<br>
Hail 'til I reach Hell, I ain't scared<br>
Mama checking in my bedroom; I ain't there<br>
I got a head with no screws in it, what can I do<br>
One life to live but I got nothing to lose, just me and you<br>
On a one way trip to prison, selling drugs<br>
We all wrapped up in this living, life as Thugs<br>
To my homeboys in Clinton Max, doing they bid<br>
Raise hell to this real shit, and feel this<br>
When they turn out the lights, I'll be down in the dark<br>
Thuggin eternal through my heart, now Hail Mary nigga<br><br>
<b>Nakarat</b><br>
Come with me, Hail Mary<br>
Run quick see, what do we have here<br>
Now, do you wanna ride or die<br>
La dadada, la la la la<br><br>
Come with me, Hail Mary<br>
Run quick see, what do we have here<br>
Now, do you wanna ride or die<br>
La dadada, la la la la<br><br>
<b>Verse 4</b><br>
They got a APB, out on my Thug family<br>
Since the Outlawz run these streets, like these skanless freaks<br>
Our enemies die now, walk around half dead<br>
Head down, K blasted off Hennessee and Thai<br>
Trying it, mixed it, now I'm twisted blisted and high<br>
Visions of me, Thug living getting me by<br>
Forever live, and I multiply survived by Thugs<br>
When I die they won't cry unless they coming with slugs<br>
Peep the whole scene and whatever's going on around me<br>
Brain kinda cloudy, smoked out feeling rowdy<br>
Ready to wet the party up, and whoever in that motherfucker<br>
Nasty new street, slugger my heat seeks suckers<br>
On the regular mashing in a stolen black Ac Integ-ra<br>
Cock back, sixty seconds 'til the draw that's when I'm dead in ya<br>
Feet first, you got a nice gat but my heat's worse<br>
From a Thug to preaching church, I gave you love now you eating dirt<br>
Needing work, and I ain't the nigga to put you on<br>
Cause word is bond when I was broke I had to hustle 'til dawn<br>
That's when sun came up, there's only one way up<br>
Hold ya head and stay up, to all my niggas get ya pay and weight up<br>
If it's on then it's on, we break beat-breaks<br>
Outlawz on a paper chase, can you relate<br>
To this shit I don't got, be the shit I gotta take<br>
Dealing with fate, hoping God don't close the gate<br>
If it's on then it's on, we break beat-breaks<br>
Outlawz on a paper chase, can you relate<br>
To this shit I don't got, be the shit I gotta take<br>
Dealing with fate, hoping God don't close the gate<br><br>
<b>Nakarat</b><br>
Come with me, Hail Mary<br>
Run quick see, what do we have here<br>
Now, do you wanna ride or die<br>
La dadada, la la la la<br><br>
<b>Verse 5</b><br>
We've been traveling on this wayward road<br>
Long time 'til I be take a 'eavy load<br>
But we ride, ride it like a bullet<br>
Hail Mary, Hail Mary<br>
We won't worry everything will come real<br>
Free like the bird in the tree<br>
We won't worry everything will come real<br>
Yes we free like the bird in the tree<br>
We running from the penitentiary<br>
This is the time for we liberty<br>
Hail Mary, Hail Mary<br><br>
<b>Nakarat</b><br>
Come with me, Hail Mary<br>
Run quick see, what do we have here<br>
Now, do you wanna ride or die<br>
La dadada, la la la la<br><br>
Come with me, Hail Mary<br>
Run quick see, what do we have here<br>
Now, do you wanna ride or die<br>
La dadada, la la la la
